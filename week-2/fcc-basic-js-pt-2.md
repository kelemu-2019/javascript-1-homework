Variables
// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;

//Assigning Value to the variable
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
var a= 7;
b=a;

//Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
// Example
var ourVar = 19;

// Only change code below this line
var a= 9;

//Understanding Uninitialized Variables

// Initialize these three variables
var a=5;
var b=10;
var c="I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";


//Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
// Declarations

var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments

//Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
var sum = 10 + 10;

//Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
var difference = 45 - 33;
//Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
var product = 8 * 10;

//Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
var quotient = 66 / 33;

//Increment a Number with JavaScript
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line and decriment 
 myVar++;
 var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;

//Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal= 5.7;
//Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
var product = 2.0 * 2.5;

// Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Fix this line

//Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
// Only change code below this line

var remainder=11%3;
//Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

//Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only modify code below this line

a -=  6;
b -=  15;
c -=  1;


//var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;

// Only modify code below this line

a  *=5;
b  *var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only modify code below this line

a  /= 12;

//scaping Literal Quotes in Strings
In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line

//Escape Sequences in Strings
Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed

var myStr= "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"; // Change this line

result FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine

//Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr=  "This is the start. " + "This is the end." ;

//Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. " ;
myStr +="This is the second sentence.";

//Constructing Strings with Variables
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName="kelemu";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName +  " and I am well!";




var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only modify code below this line

a  /= 12;
b  /= 4;
c  /=  11;
